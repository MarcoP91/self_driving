# Self-driving car with CNN 
With Keras, Tensorflow and Flask. <br>
Source: udacity car simulator: https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim <br>
Using images from the simulator labeled with the steering angle at that point of the simulation, train a CNN to predict the steering angle for future curves,
and communicate the command to the simulator through Flask.
